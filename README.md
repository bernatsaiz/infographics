# Infographics to combat misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines and climate change

Selection various infographics and data visualization projects made by Bernat Saiz in collaboration with other reporters at Verificat. All these infographics were part of the "Lies threaten our health" ("Les mentides amenacen la salut" in Catalan) project. They were included in full-length articles published in collaboration with [El Peri√≥dico de Catalunya](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/autor/verificat-1017171). They are presented individually to enhance their visibility. They were all designed by Bernat Saiz, with text provided by [Andrea Arnal](https://www.verificat.cat/andrea-arnal/), a science reporter, and fact-checker at Verificat. All infographics were exported using [Ai2HTML](https://ai2html.org/) by The New York Times.
